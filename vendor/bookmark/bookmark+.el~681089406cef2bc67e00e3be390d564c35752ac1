;;(@* "Installing Bookmark+")
;;  ** Installing Bookmark+ **
;;
;;  Put this library in your `load-path'.
;;  Add this to your init file (~/.emacs) : (require 'bookmark+)
;;
;;
;;(@* "Bookmark+ Features")
;;  ** Bookmark+ Features **
;;
;;  Here is an overview of the features that Bookmark+ provides.  Some
;;  of these are detailed in other sections, below.
;;
;;  * Richer bookmarks.  They record more.  They are more accurate.
;;
;;     - You can tag bookmarks, a la del.icio.us.  This is perhaps the
;;       most important Bookmark+ feature.  In effect, tags define
;;       bookmark sets.  A bookmark can have any number of tags, and
;;       multiple bookmarks can have the same tag.  You can mark or
;;       show just the bookmarks with a given tag or a set of tags.
;;
;;     - Bookmark tags can in fact be more than just names.  They can
;;       be full-fledged user-defined attributes, with Emacs-Lisp
;;       objects as their values.
;;
;;     - Bookmarks record the number of visits and the time of the
;;       last visit.  You can sort, show/hide, or mark bookmarks based
;;       on this info.
;;
;;     - You can combine bookmarks, to make composite, or sequence,
;;       bookmarks.  Invoking a sequence bookmark invokes each of its
;;       component bookmarks in turn.  A component bookmark can itself
;;       be a sequence bookmark.
;;
;;     - You can bookmark a region of text, not just a position.  When
;;       you jump to a bookmark that records a region, the region is
;;       activated (see option `bookmarkp-use-region-flag').  (Region
;;       activation is not supported for Gnus bookmarks.)
;;
;;     - Bookmarks are relocated better than for vanilla Emacs when
;;       the contextual text changes.
;;
;;  * Additional types of bookmarks.
;;
;;     - You can bookmark a Dired buffer, recording and restoring its
;;       `ls' switches, which files are marked, which subdirectories
;;       are inserted, and which (sub)directories are hidden.
;;
;;     - You can bookmark a buffer that is not associated with a file.
;;
;;     - You can bookmark the current desktop, as defined by library
;;       `desktop.el' - use command `bookmarkp-set-desktop-bookmark'
;;       (`C-x p K').  You can "jump" to (that is, restore) a saved
;;       desktop.  A desktop includes:
;;
;;         - Some global variables.  To exclude variables normally
;;           saved, see option `bookmarkp-desktop-no-save-vars'.
;; 	   - The current set of buffers and their associated files.
;;           For each: its mode, point, mark, & some local variables.
;;
;;     - You can bookmark a Gnus article, a URL (if you use W3M), a
;;       PDF file (DocView), an image, or a UNIX manual page (from the
;;       output of Emacs command `man' or `woman').
;;
;;     - A bookmark can represent a function, which is invoked when
;;       you "jump" to the bookmark.
;;
;;     - As mentioned above, a bookmark can represent a sequence of
;;       other bookmarks.
;;
;;     - You can bookmark buffer `*Bookmark List*' itself.  Jumping to
;;       such a bookmark restores the recorded sort order, filter,
;;       title, and omit list (see (@> "Omitting Bookmarks from
;;       Display")).
;;
;;  * Type-specific jump commands.
;;
;;     - When you want to jump to a bookmark of a specific type
;;       (e.g. Dired), you can use a command that offers only such
;;       bookmarks as completion candidates.
;;
;;  * Improvements for the bookmark list (buffer `*Bookmark List*',
;;    aka "menu list") that is displayed using `C-x r l'.
;;
;;     - The last display state is saved (by default), and is restored
;;       the next time you show the list.  (Tip: Use the bookmark list
;;       as your "Home" page at Emacs startup.)
;;
;;     - Marking/unmarking is enhanced.  It is similar to Dired's.
;;
;;     - You can easily mark or show different classes of bookmarks.
;;
;;     - Faces distinguish bookmarks by type.
;;
;;     - You can sort bookmarks in many ways.  You can easily define
;;       your own sort orders, even complex ones.
;;
;;     - You can regexp-search (`M-a') or query-replace (`M-q') the
;;       targets (destination file or buffers) of the marked
;;       bookmarks, in the current bookmark-list sort order.  For
;;       Emacs 23 and later, you can even search incrementally (`M-s a
;;       C-s', or `M-s a C-M-s' for regexp).
;;
;;     - You can save the current bookmark-list state and return to it
;;       later.  There are a few ways to do this, including
;;       bookmarking the list itself.
;;       See (@> "Bookmark-List Views - Saving and Restoring State").
;;
;;     - You can use `M-d >' to open Dired for just the local file and
;;       directory bookmarks that are marked (`>').
;;
;;     - If you use Emacs on Microsoft Windows, you can open bookmarks
;;       according to Windows file associations.  (You will also need
;;       library `w32-browser.el'.)
;;
;;     - You can edit a bookmark (its name and file name).
;;
;;     - A popup menu is available on `mouse-3', with actions for the
;;       individual bookmark you point to when you click the mouse.
;;
;;     - A complete menu, `Bookmark+', is provided on the menu-bar.
;;       Use it, in particular, when you don't remember a key binding.
;;       The same menu is available on `C-mouse-3'.
;;
;;     - The vanilla `Bookmarks' menu, which is typically a submenu of
;;       the `Edit' menu-bar menu, is modified by adding a few items
;;       from the `Bookmark+' menu, including the `Jump To' submenu
;;       (called `Jump To Bookmark' there).
;;
;;  * Multiple bookmark files.
;;
;;     - Although vanilla Emacs lets you load different bookmark
;;       files, this feature is not well supported, if not
;;       contradictory.  With Bookmark+ you can easily switch among
;;       alternative bookmark files or load multiple files into the
;;       same session, accumulating their bookmark definitions.
;;
;;  * Dedicated prefix keys.
;;
;;     - Prefix `C-x p' is used for bookmark keys, in general.  The
;;       vanilla keys on prefix `C-x r' are still available also, but
;;       that prefix is shared with register commands, making it less
;;       convenient for bookmarks.  Using `C-x p' lets you focus on
;;       bookmarks.
;;
;;     - Prefixes `C-x j' and `C-x 4 j' (for other-window) are used
;;       for bookmark jump commands.  Again, a dedicated prefix key
;;       helps you focus on one kind of action (jumping).
;;
;;  * Helpful help.
;;
;;     - It's easy to get information about individual bookmarks, in
;;       addition to information about the current bookmark list
;;       (buffer `*Bookmark List*').
;;
;;       . Command `bookmarkp-describe-bookmark' (`C-x p ?') describes
;;         any bookmark.  With a prefix argument, it shows you the
;;         full information that defines it (internal form).
;;
;;       . In the bookmark list, `C-h RET' (or `C-h C-RET') describes
;;         the bookmark under the cursor.  Again, a prefix arg means
;;         show the full (internal) information.
;;
;;       . In the bookmark list, `?' or `C-h m' shows you detailed
;;         information about the current state of the bookmark list.
;;
;;  * Synergy with Icicles.
;;
;;     - If you use Icicles, then you can use `S-delete' during
;;       completion for a bookmark name, to delete the current
;;       bookmark candidate.  You can delete any number of bookmarks
;;       this way, during a single invocation of a bookmark command.
;;
;;       In addition, Icicles provides enhanced bookmark jumping
;;       (visiting) and setting.  In Icicle mode, several of the
;;       Bookmark+ keys are remapped to corresponding Icicles
;;       multi-commands.  This means that a bookmark jump key becomes
;;       a bookmarks browser.  For example, you can use `C-x 4 j d' to
;;       browse among any number of Dired bookmarks.  See
;;       http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/Icicles.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Different Types of Jump Commands")
;;  ** Different Types of Jump Commands **
;;
;;  When you jump to a bookmark, you can use completion to specify the
;;  bookmark name.  With Bookmark+ you can easily have a large number
;;  of bookmarks.  If you want to jump to a bookmark of a specific
;;  type, such as Info, you can use a Bookmark+ command that is
;;  specific to bookmarks of that type: only those bookmarks are
;;  completion candidates.
;;
;;  Commands `bookmarkp-jump-to-type' and
;;  `bookmarkp-jump-to-type-other-window' prompt you first for the
;;  type of bookmark you want to jump to, then for a bookmark of that
;;  type (only).
;;
;;  In addition to these general commands, there are type-specific
;;  commands: `bookmarkp-dired-jump', `bookmarkp-info-jump', and so
;;  on.  Such commands are bound to keys that have the prefix `C-x j'.
;;  `bookmarkp-dired-jump' is bound to `C-x j d',
;;  `bookmarkp-info-jump' to `C-x j i', and so on.
;;
;;  There are several commands for jumping to a bookmark with tags.
;;  The completion candidates can be those bookmarks that have all
;;  tags in a given set, some tags in a given set, all tags matching a
;;  regexp, or some tags matching a regexp.  You are prompted for the
;;  set of tags or the regexp to match.  These commands all have the
;;  prefix key `C-x j t', with the regexp-matching ones having the
;;  prefix key `C-x j t %'.  The key suffix is `*' for "all" and `+'
;;  for "some".
;;
;;  There is an other-window version of most jump commands, and it is
;;  bound to the same key as the same-window command, except the
;;  prefix is `C-x 4 j', not `C-x j'.  For instance,
;;  `bookmarkp-dired-jump-other-window' is bound to `C-x 4 j d'.
;;
;;  These bindings round out the jump-command prefix keys:
;;
;;    C-x j j    - bookmark-jump
;;    C-x j :    - bookmarkp-jump-to-type
;;
;;    C-x 4 j j  - bookmark-jump-other-window
;;    C-x 4 j :  - bookmarkp-jump-to-type-other-window
;;
;;  The `C-x j' and `C-x 4 j' bindings are global.  In addition, in
;;  some modes `j' is bound to the corresponding type-specific jump
;;  command.  For example, in Info mode, `j' is bound to
;;  `bookmarkp-info-jump'.  (Dired is an exception here: `J' is used
;;  instead of `j', since `j' is already taken for `dired-goto-file'.)
;;  These commands are also added to the mode's menu-bar menu.
;;
;;  In Dired mode, `C-j' is bound to a special Dired-specific jump
;;  command, `bookmarkp-dired-jump-current', whose destinations all
;;  use the current Dired directory.  The aim of `C-j' is not to
;;  change directories but to change to a different set of markings,
;;  switches, inserted subdirectories, or hidden subdirectories for
;;  the same Dired directory.
;;
;;  Finally, in addition to the predefined bookmark types, which you
;;  can use as described above, you can define a "type"-specific jump
;;  command for any set of bookmarks.  That is, you can use any
;;  specific set of bookmarks as the completion candidates for a new
;;  jump command.  Such a set is really only a pseudo-type: the actual
;;  bookmarks can each be of any type.
;;
;;  You could use this feature, for example, to define a jump command
;;  for the bookmarks that belong to a given project.
;;
;;  To define such a command, you first mark the bookmarks that you
;;  want to be the completion candidates, then you use `M-c' (command
;;  `bookmarkp-bmenu-define-jump-marked-command') in the bookmark
;;  list.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Bookmark Tags")
;;  ** Bookmark Tags **
;;
;;  With Bookmark+ you can bookmark several kinds of Emacs object.
;;  Bookmarks record locations - that is their primary purpose.  They
;;  can also record annotations: general free-text descriptions of
;;  your choosing.
;;
;;  Bookmark+ bookmarks can also be tagged, in del.icio.us style, as a
;;  way to organize them, which also means as a way to organize the
;;  objects that are bookmarked.  A bookmark tag is a string that
;;  contains no newline characters.
;;
;;  You can add as many tags as you like to any bookmark, and multiple
;;  bookmarks can have the same tag(s).  In fact, that's the whole
;;  idea behind using them for organizing.
;;
;;  This feature is unrelated to the fact that bookmarks record
;;  locations and are useful for navigating.  You can, if you want,
;;  use bookmarks to tag files in various ways purely for purposes of
;;  organizing them (e.g. into projects), whether or not you ever use
;;  the bookmarks as a way to visit them.
;;
;;  For example, if you use Dired+ (library `dired+.el'), then you can
;;  use `M-b' (`diredp-do-bookmark') in Dired to create a bookmark for
;;  each of the marked files in the Dired buffer.  Even if you never
;;  use those bookmarks for navigating to the files, you can use them
;;  with tags to organize the files.  See also
;;  (@> "Open Bookmarks Using Windows File Associations").
;;
;;  To make tags more useful, Bookmark+ provides lots of commands:
;;  commands for adding or removing tags, and for marking or unmarking
;;  bookmarks that are tagged in various ways.  When combined with
;;  other Bookmark+ commands (e.g. search, query-replace) that apply
;;  to the marked bookmarks in the `*Bookmark List*' window, you can
;;  really do quite a lot using bookmark tags.  Use your imagination!
;;  See (@> "Tag Commands and Keys") for more about this.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Bookmark Tags Can Have Values")
;;  ** Bookmark Tags Can Have Values **
;;
;;  Bookmark tags are simply names (strings) when you create them.
;;  Nearly all of the predefined operations that use tags use these
;;  names: sorting, marking, and so on.  But you can in fact add an
;;  associated value to each tag.  This means that a tag can act just
;;  like an object attribute or property: it can be a name/value pair.
;;
;;  To add a value to a tag, or to change the current value, you use
;;  command `bookmarkp-set-tag-value', bound to `T v' in the bookmark
;;  list.  You are prompted for the bookmark, the tag, and the new
;;  value.
;;
;;  A tag value can be a number, symbol, string, list, vector, and so
;;  on.  It can be as complex as you like.  It can be any Emacs-Lisp
;;  object that has read syntax, that is, that is readable by the Lisp
;;  reader.  (Everything that is saved as part of a bookmark must be
;;  readable; otherwise, your bookmark file could not be read
;;  (loaded).)
;;
;;  Because tag values can be pretty much anything, you are pretty
;;  much on your own when it comes to making use of them.  Bookmark+
;;  does not provide predefined functions for using tag values.  In
;;  general, tag values are something you will use with home-grown
;;  Lisp code for your own purposes.
;;
;;  However, you can easily make some interactive use of tag values
;;  with little effort.  You can, for example, define a predicate that
;;  tests whether a bookmark has a tag value that satisfies some
;;  property (e.g. is a number greater than 3.14159265358979), and
;;  then you can use command
;;  `bookmarkp-bmenu-mark-bookmarks-satisfying' to mark those
;;  bookmarks.
;;
;;  Tags that have the prefix "bookmarkp-" are reserved - do not name
;;  your own tags using this prefix.
;;
;;  Currently, "bookmarkp-jump" is the only predefined bookmark tag.
;;  You can give this tag a value that is a function - it is called
;;  whenever the tagged bookmark is visited.  Any Lisp-readable
;;  function value is allowed: a symbol or a lambda expression.
;;
;;  For example, you can use `T v (lambda () (message "Hello!"))' to
;;  display `Hello!' whenever the bookmark with this tag is visited.
;;
;;  The function that is the value of a "bookmarkp-jump" tag is called
;;  just after the the standard hook `bookmark-jump-hook' is invoked.
;;  You can use this tag to invoke functions that are specific to
;;  individual bookmarks; bookmarks can thus have their own, extra
;;  jump functions.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Function and Sequence Bookmarks")
;;  ** Function and Sequence Bookmarks **
;;
;;  Bookmarks are typically thought of only as recorded locations.
;;  Invoking a bookmark, called "jumping" to it, traditionally means
;;  just visiting its location.  Bookmark+ looks at bookmarks in a
;;  more general way than that.  A bookmark is a shortcut of some
;;  kind - nothing more.
;;
;;  A given type of bookmark is defined by its handler function, which
;;  really could do anything you like.  We've already seen the
;;  examples of region bookmarks, which restore the active region, and
;;  Dired bookmarks, which restore a set of Dired markings, switches,
;;  inserted subdirectories, and hidden (sub)directories.
;;
;;  A "function bookmark" simply invokes some function - any function.
;;  You can, for instance, define a window or frame configuration and
;;  record that as a bookmark.  Then jump to the bookmark to switch
;;  contexts.  (You can also bookmark a desktop and jump to that.)
;;
;;  Function bookmarks might not seem too interesting, since we have
;;  other ways of invoking functions in Emacs.  But the other features
;;  of Bookmark+ combine with this feature.  You can, for instance,
;;  tag such bookmarks.
;;
;;  And you can combine them, invoking the functions sequentially.
;;  This is just a particular case of using a "sequence bookmark",
;;  which simply records a sequence of bookmarks.  The bookmarks in a
;;  sequence can be of any kind, including other sequence bookmarks.
;;
;;  Command `bookmarkp-make-function-bookmark' creates a function
;;  bookmark - you give it a function symbol or a lambda expression.
;;  Command `bookmarkp-bmenu-make-sequence-from-marked' creates a
;;  sequence from the marked bookmarks in the bookmark list, in their
;;  current order.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Bookmark-List Views - Saving and Restoring State")
;;  ** Bookmark-List Views - Saving and Restoring State **
;;
;;  The bookmark list (buffer `*Bookmark List*') provides a view into
;;  the set of bookmarks.  You can mark, sort, and hide (filter, omit)
;;  bookmarks - see (@> "Bookmark List (Display)").  The state of the
;;  displayed bookmark list can thus change.
;;
;;  At different times, and in different contexts, different views can
;;  be useful.  Bookmark+ lets you save the current state of the
;;  displayed list and later restore it.  There are a couple of
;;  different ways to do this.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Quitting Saves the Bookmark-List State")
;;  *** Quitting Saves the Bookmark-List State ***
;;
;;  If option `bookmarkp-bmenu-state-file' is non-nil, which it is by
;;  default, then Bookmark+ remembers the last state of the bookmark
;;  list when you quit it or you quit Emacs, and it restores that
;;  state when you show the list again (which could be in the next
;;  Emacs session).  You can think of this feature as your "Home" page
;;  for bookmarks, giving you a stepping stone to the files and
;;  directories you use most.
;;
;;  If, for example, when you quit the bookmark list you are showing
;;  only bookmarks to Info nodes and UNIX manual pages, sorted in a
;;  particular way, and with some of them marked for particular
;;  processing, then the next time you open the list the same state is
;;  restored: the same set of bookmarks is shown, in the same order,
;;  with the same markings.
;;
;;  You can turn off this automatic bookmark-list display state
;;  saving, if you want, by customizing option
;;  `bookmarkp-bmenu-state-file' to nil.  And you can toggle this
;;  option at any time, using `M-l' in the bookmark list (command
;;  `bookmarkp-toggle-saving-menu-list-state').  In particular, if you
;;  want your next visit to the bookmark list to start out with a
;;  previously recorded state instead of the current state, just hit
;;  `M-l' before quitting the bookmark list.
;;
;;
;;(@* "State-Restoring Commands and Bookmarks")
;;  *** State-Restoring Commands and Bookmarks ***
;;
;;  In addition to automatically saving/restoring the final
;;  bookmark-list display state, you can save this state at any time,
;;  any number of times, for later restoration.  This gives you the
;;  ability to create multiple persistent views of your bookmarks.
;;
;;  There are two ways to do this:
;;
;;  * Create a bookmark for the `*Bookmark List*' buffer itself.
;;  * Define a command that restores the bookmark-list state.
;;
;;  When you use `C-x r m' (`bookmark-set') in buffer `*Bookmark
;;  List*' to create a bookmark, the current sort order, filter,
;;  title, and omit list are saved as part of the bookmark.  (These
;;  concepts are described below -
;;  see (@> "Bookmark List (Display)").)  Jumping to such a bookmark
;;  restores all of these.
;;
;;  Alternatively, you can define a command that does the same thing,
;;  but without creating another bookmark - use `c'
;;  (`bookmarkp-bmenu-define-command') in the bookmark list to do
;;  this.  You are prompted for the name of the new command.  Use the
;;  command anytime (including in another Emacs session) to restore
;;  the bookmark list.
;;
;;  Define any number of such commands for the views you use.  The
;;  file for saving the definitions (see option
;;  `bookmarkp-bmenu-commands-file') is never overwritten, so you can
;;  also add other code to it manually, if you want.  The file is read
;;  the first time the bookmark list is displayed in a given Emacs
;;  session.
;;
;;  The state that is saved and restored using a bookmark-list
;;  bookmark or a command defined using `c' is only a partial state.
;;  The current set of markings and some other information is not
;;  saved, in order to save disk space and save/restore time.
;;
;;  Sometimes, however, you really want to save the entire
;;  bookmark-list state, creating a full snapshot.  You can use `C'
;;  (`bookmarkp-bmenu-define-full-snapshot-command') to do that.  This
;;  defines a command that restores the bookmark list completely.
;;  That is the same thing that happens automatically (by default)
;;  whenever you quit the bookmark list (or Emacs), but defining
;;  snapshot commands lets you have multiple saved states and switch
;;  to them at will.
;;
;;  Be aware, however, that full-snapshot command definitions can be
;;  quite large, since they each contain a copy of the current
;;  bookmark list and any accessory lists (hidden and marked bookmarks
;;  etc.).
;;
;;  Whether you use `c' or `C' to define a state-restoring command or
;;  you create a bookmark-list bookmark, you can create a sequence
;;  bookmark that combines such bookmark-list restoration with
;;  activation of other bookmarks.  (To include a state-restoring
;;  command in a sequence, you need to first create a function
;;  bookmark that uses the command, and then include that bookmark in
;;  the sequence.)
;;
;;
;;(@* "Using Multiple Bookmark Files")
;;  ** Using Multiple Bookmark Files **
;;
;;  Bookmark-list views (see
;;  (@> "Bookmark-List Views - Saving and Restoring State")) provide
;;  one way to switch among various sets of bookmarks that you use.
;;  But that feature affects only the bookmarks that you see displayed
;;  in buffer `*Bookmark List*', not the actual set of available
;;  bookmarks.
;;
;;  The bookmarks available to you are defined in a bookmark file.  By
;;  default, they are stored in the file named by option
;;  `bookmark-default-file' (`~/.emacs.bmk', by default).  You do not
;;  need to load or save this file manually; Emacs does that for you
;;  automatically.
;;
;;  But you can also have extra, alternative bookmark files if you
;;  want, and at any time you can change the bookmark file that is
;;  current.  To do that, use `C-x p L' (uppercase `L'), which is
;;  bound to command `bookmarkp-switch-bookmark-file'.  You can see
;;  which file is current by using `?' or `C-h m' in the buffer
;;  `*Bookmark List*' (or anywhere else using `M-x
;;  bookmarkp-bmenu-mode-status-help').
;;
;;  Having multiple bookmark files gives you an added degree of
;;  flexibility, but you must keep track of these extra bookmark files
;;  yourself - they are not managed for you automatically.
;;
;;  When bookmarks are saved automatically, or when you save them
;;  using `bookmark-save' (`S' in the bookmark list or `C-x p s'
;;  globally) and you don't use a prefix argument, they are saved in
;;  the current bookmark file.
;;
;;  You can turn off the automatic saving of the current bookmark
;;  file, by customizing option `bookmark-save-flag' to nil.  And you
;;  can toggle this option at any time, using `M-~' in the bookmark
;;  list (command `bookmarkp-toggle-saving-bookmark-file').
;;
;;  Besides using multiple bookmark files as alternatives, you can
;;  combine them, using them as component bookmark subsets (like
;;  modules).  To do that, use command `C-x p l' (lowercase `l'),
;;  which is bound to `bookmark-load', and do not use a prefix
;;  argument.  (Using a prefix argument with `C-x p l' is the same as
;;  using `C-x p L': it switches bookmark files.)
;;
;;  To create additional bookmark files, to use as either alternatives
;;  or component files, you can either copy an existing bookmark file
;;  or use `bookmarkp-empty-file' (`C-x p 0') to create a new, empty
;;  bookmark file.  If you use `C-x p 0' with an existing bookmark
;;  file, then its bookmarks are all deleted - it is emptied.
;;
;;  Instead of simply copying a bookmark file, you can use
;;  `bookmark-save' with a prefix argument, or use `bookmark-write'
;;  (bound to `C-x p w'), to save the currently defined bookmarks to a
;;  different bookmark file.
;;
;;  However a bookmark file was created, you can switch to it and then
;;  add or delete bookmarks selectively, to change its content.
;;  Remember that you can delete bookmarks from the current set using
;;  command `bookmark-delete' (`C-x p d') or, in the bookmark list,
;;  using `d' plus `x' or marking then `D'.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Bookmark List (Display)")
;;  ** Bookmark List (Display) **
;;
;;  Bookmark+ enhances the bookmark list (aka the bookmark "menu
;;  list", a misnomer) that is displayed in buffer `*Bookmark List*'
;;  when you use `C-x r l' (command `bookmark-bmenu-list').
;;
;;  Bookmarks are highlighted to indicate their type. You can mark and
;;  unmark bookmarks, show or hide bookmarks of particular types, and
;;  more.  Bookmarks that have tags are marked with a `t'.  Bookmarks
;;  that have an annotation are marked with an `a' (not with a `*' as
;;  in vanilla `bookmark.el').
;;
;;  Use `?' or `C-h m' in buffer `*Bookmark List*' for more
;;  information about the bookmark list, including:
;;
;;  * The current status of sorting, filtering, and marking.
;;
;;  * A legend for the faces used for different bookmark types.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Tag Commands and Keys")
;;  *** Tag Commands and Keys***
;;
;;  There are lots of tag-related bookmark commands, and they are all
;;  bound to keys in buffer `*Bookmark List*'.  How can you keep them
;;  straight or remember the keys?
;;
;;  `C-h m' (or `?') is your friend, of course.  Beyond that, the
;;  tag-related keys are organized as follows:
;;
;;    They all have the prefix key `T'.
;;
;;    `m' means mark
;;    `u' means unmark
;;    `>' stands for the marked bookmarks
;;    `*' means AND (set intersection; all)
;;    `+' means OR  (set union; some/any)
;;    `~' means NOT (set complement)
;;
;;  The key `T m *', for instance, marks (`m') the bookmarks that are
;;  tagged with all (`*' = AND) of a given set of tags.  It prompts you
;;  for one or more tags that the bookmarks must have, and it marks
;;  all bookmarks that have all of the tags you enter.
;;
;;  The key `T u ~ +' unmarks (`u') the bookmarks that do not (`~')
;;  have any (`+' = OR) of the tags you specify.  And so on.
;;
;;  The marking and unmarking commands for tags compare the tags a
;;  bookmark has with tags that you enter.  Any bookmarks that have no
;;  tags are ignored - they are neither marked nor unmarked by these
;;  commands.
;;
;;  `+' and `-' can also mean add and remove tags, respectively, and
;;  `>' stands for the marked bookmarks.  So `T > +' adds (`+') one or
;;  more tags to each of the marked (`>') bookmarks.
;;
;;  In general, the tag-related commands let you enter a set of tags,
;;  one at a time.  Thus, instead of having a command that adds a
;;  single tag to the current bookmark, you have a command that adds
;;  any number of tags to it.  To add just a single tag, hit `RET'
;;  twice: once to enter the tag, and once again to indicate that it
;;  is the last (i.e., the only) one.
;;
;;  If you just hit `RET' immediately, specifying an empty set of
;;  tags, then each of the commands does something different, but
;;  reasonable.  For `T m *', for instance, an empty list of tags
;;  means to mark (only) the bookmarks that have any tags at all.
;;
;;  Finally, for the marking/unmarking tags commands, a prefix
;;  argument flips the sense of the command, in this way:
;;
;;  "some are" -> "some are NOT", i.e., "not all are" (and vice versa)
;;  "all are"  -> "all are NOT",  i.e., "none are"    (and vice versa)
;;
;;  In other words:
;;
;;    C-u T m *    =  T m ~ +  (all are NOT      = not some are)
;;    C-u T m ~ +  =  T m *    (not some are NOT = all are)
;;    C-u T m +    =  T m ~ *  (some are NOT     = not all are)
;;    C-u T m ~ *  =  T m +    (not all are NOT  = some are)
;;
;;  You'll figure it out ;-).
;;
;;  Remember that `C-h RET' shows you the tags that belong to the
;;  current bookmark (under the cursor).  And `C-u C-h RET' shows you
;;  the full internal form of the tags, that is, the name+value pairs.
;;
;;  You can also sort bookmarks according to how they are tagged, even
;;  in complex ways.  See (@> "Sorting Bookmarks").
;;
;;
;;(@* "Sets of Bookmarks")
;;  *** Sets of Bookmarks ***
;;
;;  The best way to think about tags is as names of sets.  All
;;  bookmarks tagged `blue' constitute the bookmark set named `blue'.
;;
;;  The bookmarks visible in the bookmark list at any time also
;;  constitute an unnamed set.  Likewise, the marked bookmarks and the
;;  unmarked bookmarks are unnamed sets.  Bookmark+ is all about
;;  helping you act on sets of Emacs objects.  Bookmarks are named,
;;  persistent pointers to objects such as files and file sets.
;;  Bookmark tags are named, persistent sets of bookmarks (and hence
;;  of their target objects).
;;
;;  The marking commands make it easy to combine sets as unions or
;;  intersections.  And you can give the result a name for quick
;;  access later, just by adding a new tag.  in other words, do the
;;  set-definition work only once, and name the result.
;;
;;  How would you tag as `Java IDE Projects' the bookmarks that are
;;  already tagged both `Java' and `ide'?
;;
;;  1. `T m * Java RET ide RET RET', to mark them.
;;  2. `T + Java IDE Projects RET RET, to tag them.
;;
;;  How would you sort your bookmarks, to show all those tagged both
;;  `blue' and `moon' first?
;;
;;  1. `T m * blue RET moon RET RET', to mark them.
;;  2. `s >' to sort the marked bookmarks first
;;     (see (@> "Sorting Bookmarks"), below).
;;
;;  If you wanted to show only the marked bookmarks, instead of
;;  sorting to put them first in the list, you would use `>'
;;  instead of `s >'.
;;
;;  How would you query-replace the set of files that are tagged with
;;  any of the tags `alpha', `beta', and `gamma', but are not tagged
;;  `blue' or `moon'?
;;
;;    1. `F S', to show only the file bookmarks.
;;    2. `T m + alpha RET beta RET gamma RET RET', to mark the
;;       bookmarks that have at least one of those tags.
;;    3. `T u + blue RET moon RET RET', to unmark those that are
;;       tagged `blue' or `moon'.
;;    4. `M-q' to query-replace the marked files.
;;
;;  If that were a set of files that you used often, then you would
;;  name the set by giving the files a new tag.
;;
;;  The point is that bookmarks, and bookmark tags in particular, let
;;  you define and manipulate sets of Emacs objects.  It doesn't
;;  matter how you define such a set: regexp matching (marking,
;;  filtering), by object type, by tag combinations...  Sets need not
;;  be named to act on them, but you can provide them with persistent
;;  names (tags) to avoid redefining them over and over.  Manipulation
;;  of bookmarked objects includes visiting, searching, and
;;  query-replacing.  And you can define your own bookmark types
;;  (using bookmark handlers) and associated manipulations.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Open Dired for the Marked Files")
;;  *** Open Dired for the Marked Files ***
;;
;;  You've seen that the bookmark list has many features that are
;;  similar to Dired features.  But Dired is specialized for files and
;;  directories, and it has many more features for manipulating them.
;;  The bookmark list is not intended to replace Dired.
;;
;;  You can, however, use the bookmark list to take advantage of
;;  arbitrary Dired features for file and directory bookmarks.
;;  Command `bookmarkp-bmenu-dired-marked' (`M-d >') weds Bookmark+'s
;;  set-defining and set-manipulating features (tagging, marking,
;;  filtering etc.) to Dired's file-manipulating features.
;;
;;  `M-d >' opens a Dired buffer that is specialized for just the
;;  files and directories whose bookmarks are marked in the bookmark
;;  list.  (Other marked bookmarks are ignored by the command.)  The
;;  files and directories can be located anywhere; they need not be in
;;  the same directory.  They are listed in Dired using absolute file
;;  names.
;;
;;  (In Emacs versions prior to release 23.2, only local files and
;;  directories can be handled, due to Emacs bug #5478.  In such
;;  versions, remote-file bookmarks are ignored by `M-d >'.)
;;
;;  This Bookmark+ feature makes sets of files and directories
;;  immediately amenable to all of the operations provided by Dired.
;;
;;  It is particularly useful in conjunction with tags.  Use bookmark
;;  tags and marks to define a possibly complex set of file and
;;  directory bookmarks.  Then hit `M-d >' to list them in a Dired
;;  buffer.  Then use any Dired commands you want to act on any of
;;  them.
;;
;;  For example, to compress bookmarked files that are tagged with
;;  both `blue' and `moon':
;;
;;  1. Mark them using `T m * blue RET moon RET RET'.
;;  2. Open Dired for them using `M-d >'.
;;  3. Mark them in Dired, then compress them using `Z'.
;;
;;  Since tags are persistent, Bookmark+ gives you a good way to
;;  define an arbitrary set of files as a project and then open them
;;  in Dired at any time to operate on them.
;;
;;  If you use Dired+ (library `dired+.el'), then a similar feature is
;;  available for the marked files and directories: You can use
;;  `C-M-*' in Dired to open a separate Dired buffer for them only.
;;  You can of course then bookmark that resulting Dired buffer, if
;;  you like.
;;
;;  If you use Icicles, then whenever you use a command that reads a
;;  file (or directory) name, you can use `M-|' during file-name
;;  completion to open Dired on the currently matching set of file
;;  names.  That is, this is the same kind of special Dired buffer
;;  that is provided for file and directory bookmarks by `M-d >' in
;;  the bookmark list.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Marking and Unmarking Bookmarks")
;;  *** Marking and Unmarking Bookmarks ***
;;
;;  Bookmark+ enhances the marking and unmarking of bookmarks in the
;;  bookmark list in several ways.  These enhancements are similar to
;;  features offered by Dired and Dired-X.  You can use:
;;
;;  * `% m' to mark the bookmarks that match a regexp.  The entire
;;    line in the bookmark list is checked for a match, that is, both
;;    the bookmark name and the file name, if shown.
;;
;;  * `M-DEL' (or `U') to unmark all bookmarks, or all that are marked
;;    `>', or all that are flagged `D' for deletion.
;;
;;  * `t' to toggle (swap) the marked and unmarked bookmarks: those
;;    that are marked become unmarked, and vice versa.
;;
;;  * `>' to show only the marked bookmarks or `<' to show only the
;;    unmarked bookmarks.  Repeat to show them all again.
;;
;;  * `F M', `I M' etc. to mark only the file bookmarks, Info
;;    bookmarks etc.  (The first key here is the same as the
;;    corresponding filter key, e.g. `F' for files - see next topic.)
;;
;;
;;(@* "Filtering Bookmarks (Hiding and Showing)")
;;  *** Filtering Bookmarks (Hiding and Showing) ***
;;
;;  You can hide and show different sets of bookmarks in the bookmark
;;  list.  There are commands to show only bookmarks of a particular
;;  type - e.g. `I S' to show only Info bookmarks.  These are, in
;;  effect, shortcuts for first marking those bookmarks and then
;;  showing only the marked bookmarks (and then unmarking).  For
;;  example, `F S' is a shortcut for `F M >' (and then `U RET').
;;
;;  You can also filter to show only the bookmarks that match a given
;;  regexp.  There are two ways to do this:
;;
;;  * Use `P B' (for "pattern", "bookmark") and type a regexp.  The
;;    bookmarks are filtered incrementally, as you type.  Only the
;;    bookmark name is matched (not the file name).  Hit any
;;    non-inserting key, such as `RET', to finish defining the
;;    pattern.
;;
;;    Similarly, hit `P F' for bookmarks whose file names match a
;;    regexp, and `P T' for bookmarks with one or more tags that match
;;    a regexp.  See (@> Bookmark Tags), above, for information about
;;    tags.
;;
;;  * Just as in Dired, use `% m' to mark the bookmarks that match a
;;    regexp.  Then use `>' to show only the marked bookmarks.  See
;;    (@> "Marking and Unmarking Bookmarks"), above.
;;
;;    This method has the advantage that you can show the complement,
;;    the bookmarks that do *not* match the regexp, by using `<'
;;    instead of `>'.  It also has the advantage that matching checks
;;    the combination of bookmark name and file name (use `M-t' to
;;    toggle showing file names).
;;
;;
;;(@* "Only Visible Bookmarks Are Affected")
;;  *** Only Visible Bookmarks Are Affected ***
;;
;;  Commands that operate on the current bookmark or on the marked or
;;  the unmarked bookmarks act only on bookmarks that are displayed
;;  (not hidden).  This includes the commands that mark or unmark
;;  bookmarks.  This means that you can easily define any given set of
;;  bookmarks.
;;
;;  For example:
;;
;;    Use `F S' to show only bookmarks associated with files.
;;    Use `% m' to mark those that match a particular regexp.
;;    Use `R S' to show only bookmarks that have regions.
;;    Use `m' to mark some of those region bookmarks individually.
;;    Use `.' to show all bookmarks.
;;    Use `t' to swap marked and unmarked (so unmarked are now marked)
;;    Use `D' to delete all of the marked bookmarks (after confirming)
;;
;;  Together, steps 1-7 delete all file bookmarks that match the
;;  regexp and all region bookmarks that you selectively marked.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Omitting Bookmarks from Display")
;;  *** Omitting Bookmarks from Display ***
;;
;;  In sections (@> "Marking and Unmarking Bookmarks") and
;;  (@> "Filtering Bookmarks (Hiding and Showing)") you learned how
;;  to hide and show bookmarks in the bookmark list.  This section is
;;  about a different kind of hiding, called "omitting".
;;
;;  Omitted bookmarks are not shown in the bookmark list, no matter
;;  what filtering is used.  The only way to show omitted bookmarks is
;;  to show all of them and only them, using `O S', which is bound to
;;  command `bookmarkp-bmenu-show-only-omitted'.
;;
;;  Omitted bookmarks are still available even if they are not shown,
;;  and you can still jump to them (e.g. using `C-x r b').  You just
;;  don't see them in the bookmark list.  And that's the reason for
;;  this feature: to hide those bookmarks that you don't care to see.
;;
;;  The most common use for this feature is to hide the component
;;  bookmarks that make up a sequence bookmark (see
;;  (@> "Function and Sequence Bookmarks")).  The default behavior
;;  when you create a sequence bookmark is in fact to omit its
;;  component bookmarks from the displayed list.
;;
;;  You can omit any bookmarks by marking them and then using `O >'
;;  (`bookmarkp-bmenu-omit/unomit-marked').  If you are looking at the
;;  omitted bookmarks (after using `O S'), then `O >' un-omits the
;;  bookmarks marked there.  Think of two complementary spaces: the
;;  normal bookmark list and the omitted bookmark list.  When you use
;;  `O >', the marked bookmarks that are currently shown are moved to
;;  the opposite space.
;;
;;  You can un-omit all of the omitted bookmarks at once, using `O U'
;;  (`bookmarkp-unomit-all').  You can also call this command from
;;  outside the bookmark-list display.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Sorting Bookmarks")
;;  *** Sorting Bookmarks ***
;;
;;  Filtering hides certain kinds of bookmarks.  Sometimes, you want
;;  to see bookmarks of various kinds, but you want them to be grouped
;;  or sorted in different ways, for easy recognition, comparison, and
;;  access.
;;
;;  Bookmarks shown in the bookmark list are sorted using the current
;;  value of option `bookmark-sort-function'.  (If that is nil, they
;;  are unsorted, which means they appear in reverse chronological
;;  order of their creation.)
;;
;;  You can use `s s'... (repeat hitting the `s' key) to cycle among
;;  the various sort orders possible, updating the display
;;  accordingly.  By default, you cycle among all available sort
;;  orders, but you can shorten the cycling list by customizing option
;;  `bookmarkp-sort-orders-for-cycling-alist'.
;;
;;  You can also change directly to one of the main sort orders
;;  (without cycling) using `s n', `s f n', etc. - use `C-h m' for
;;  more info.
;;
;;  You can reverse the current sort direction (ascending/descending)
;;  using `s r'.  Also, repeating any of the main sort-order commands
;;  (e.g. `s n') cycles among that order, the reverse, and unsorted.
;;
;;  For a complex sort, which involves composing several sorting
;;  conditions, you can also use `s C-r' to reverse the order of
;;  bookmark sorting groups or the order within each group (depending
;;  on whether `s r' is also used).  Be aware that this can be a bit
;;  unintuitive.  If it does not do what you expect or want, or if it
;;  confuses you, then don't use it ;-).  (`s C-r' has no noticeable
;;  effect on simple sorting.)
;;
;;  Remember that you can combine sorting with filtering different
;;  sets of bookmarks - bookmarks of different kinds (e.g. Info) or
;;  bookmarks that are marked or unmarked.
;;
;;  Finally, you can easily define your own sorting commands and sort
;;  orders.  See macro `bookmarkp-define-sort-command' and the
;;  documentation for option `bookmarkp-sort-comparer'.  (Bookmark+
;;  uses option `bookmarkp-sort-comparer'; it *ignores* vanilla Emacs
;;  option `bookmark-sort-flag'.)
;;
;;  Of particular note is that you can interactively define commands
;;  that sort by a given list of tags - you use keys `T s' (command
;;  `bookmarkp-define-tags-sort-command') to do that.  You are
;;  prompted for the tags to sort by.  Bookmarks are sorted first
;;  according to whether they are tagged with the first tag, then the
;;  second tag, and so on.  Otherwise, sorting is by bookmark name.
;;
;;  The tags you specify are used, in order, in the name of the new
;;  command.  For example, if you enter tags `alpha', `beta', and
;;  `gamma', in that order, then the sorting command created is
;;  `bookmarkp-bmenu-sort-alpha-beta-gamma'.  The new command is saved
;;  in your bookmark commands file (`bookmarkp-bmenu-commands-file').
;;
;;  Note that because you can add a new tag to all bookmarks that have
;;  some given set of tags, you can use that single (new) tag to
;;  represent the entire tag set.  Sorting by that tag is then the
;;  same as sorting by the tag set.  You can of course use overlapping
;;  sets in the composite sort command.  You can, for example, sort
;;  first according to tag `tag1', which represents the set of tags
;;  `alpha', `beta', `gamma', `delta', and then sort according to tag
;;  `tag2', which represents the set of tags `beta', `delta'.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Open Bookmarks Using Windows File Associations")
;;  *** Open Bookmarks Using Windows File Associations ***
;;
;;  If you use Emacs on Microsoft Windows, then you can take advantage
;;  of Windows file associations to open bookmarks.  To do this, you
;;  will also need library `w32-browser.el'.
;;
;;  In the bookmark list, the following keys are bound to commands
;;  that open bookmarks using the associated Windows `Open'
;;  applications:
;;
;;    `M-RET'     - `bookmarkp-bmenu-w32-open'
;;    `M-mouse-2' - `bookmarkp-bmenu-w32-open-with-mouse'
;;    `V'         - `bookmarkp-bmenu-w32-open-select' (like `v')
;;
;;  If you use Dired+ (library `dired+.el'), then you can use `M-b' to
;;  bookmark all of the marked files in a Dired buffer, even if you
;;  normally do not or cannot visit those files in Emacs.  For
;;  instance, you can bookmark music files or image files, without
;;  ever opening them as files in Emacs.
;;
;;  Together with the use of bookmark tags, this gives you a handy way
;;  to organize and access objects of any kind whose files are
;;  recognized by Windows as being associated with a given
;;  application.  See (@> "Bookmark Tags").
;;
;;
;;(@* "Bookmark Compatibility with Vanilla Emacs (`bookmark.el')")
;;  ** Bookmark Compatibility with Vanilla Emacs (`bookmark.el') **
;;
;;  Library `bookmark+.el' is generally compatible with GNU Emacs
;;  versions 20 through 23.
;;
;;  1. All bookmarks created using any version of vanilla Emacs
;;     (library `bookmark.el') continue to work with `bookmark+.el'.
;;
;;  2. All bookmarks created using library `bookmark+.el' will work
;;     with all Emacs versions (20-23), provided you use library
;;     `bookmark+.el' to access them.
;;
;;  3. Most bookmarks created using `bookmark+.el' will not interfere
;;     with the behavior of vanilla Emacs, versions 21-23.  The new
;;     bookmark types are simply ignored by vanilla Emacs.  For
;;     example:
;;
;;     - A bookmark with a region is treated like a simple position
;;       bookmark: the destination is the region start position.
;;
;;     - A Gnus bookmark does not work; it is simply ignored.
;;
;;     However, there are two cases in which `bookmark+.el' bookmarks
;;     will raise an error in vanilla Emacs:
;;
;;     * You cannot use non-file (e.g. buffer-only) bookmarks with any
;;       version of vanilla Emacs.
;;
;;     * You cannot use any bookmarks created using `bookmark+.el'
;;       with vanilla Emacs 20.
;;
;;     The Emacs bookmark data structure has changed from version to
;;     version.  Library `bookmark+.el' always creates bookmarks that
;;     have the most recent structure (Emacs 23).  As is the case for
;;     any bookmarks that have the Emacs 23 structure, these bookmarks
;;     will not work in vanilla Emacs 20 (that is, without
;;     `bookmark+.el').
;;
;;  Bottom line: Use `bookmark+.el' to access bookmarks created using
;;  `bookmark+.el'.
;;
;;
;;(@* "New Bookmark Structure")
;;  ** New Bookmark Structure **

  "*Predicate or predicates for sorting (comparing) bookmarks.
This defines the default sort for bookmarks in the bookmark list.

Various sorting commands, such as \\<bookmark-bmenu-mode-map>\
`\\[bookmarkp-bmenu-sort-by-bookmark-visit-frequency]', change the value of this
option dynamically (but they do not save the changed value).

The value must be one of the following:

* nil, meaning do not sort

* a predicate that takes two bookmarks as args

* a list of the form ((PRED...) FINAL-PRED), where each PRED and
  FINAL-PRED are predicates that take two bookmarks as args

If the value is a list of predicates, then each PRED is tried in turn
until one returns a non-nil value.  In that case, the result is the
car of that value.  If no non-nil value is returned by any PRED, then
FINAL-PRED is used and its value is the result.

Each PRED should return `(t)' for true, `(nil)' for false, or nil for
undecided.  A nil value means that the next PRED decides (or
FINAL-PRED, if there is no next PRED).

Thus, a PRED is a special kind of predicate that indicates either a
boolean value (as a singleton list) or \"I cannot decide - let the
next guy else decide\".  (Essentially, each PRED is a hook function
that is run using `run-hook-with-args-until-success'.)

Examples:

 nil           - No sorting.

 string-lessp  - Single predicate that returns nil or non-nil.

 ((p1 p2))     - Two predicates `p1' and `p2', which each return
                 (t) for true, (nil) for false, or nil for undecided.

 ((p1 p2) string-lessp)
               - Same as previous, except if both `p1' and `p2' return
                 nil, then the return value of `string-lessp' is used.

Note that these two values are generally equivalent, in terms of their
effect (*):

 ((p1 p2))
 ((p1) p2-plain) where p2-plain is (bookmarkp-make-plain-predicate p2)

Likewise, these three values generally act equivalently (*):

 ((p1))
 (() p1-plain)
 p1-plain        where p1-plain is (bookmarkp-make-plain-predicate p1)

The PRED form lets you easily combine predicates: use `p1' unless it
cannot decide, in which case try `p2', and so on.  The value ((p2 p1))
tries the predicates in the opposite order: first `p2', then `p1' if
`p2' returns nil.

Using a single predicate or FINAL-PRED makes it easy to reuse an
existing predicate that returns nil or non-nil.

You can also convert a PRED-type predicate (which returns (t), (nil),
or nil) into an ordinary predicate, by using function
`bookmarkp-make-plain-predicate'.  That lets you reuse elsewhere, as
ordinary predicates, any PRED-type predicates you define.

For example, this defines a plain predicate to compare bookmark names:
 (defalias 'bookmarkp-alpha-p
           (bookmarkp-make-plain-predicate 'bookmarkp-alpha-cp))

Note: As a convention, predefined Bookmark+ PRED-type predicate names
have the suffix `-cp' (for \"component predicate\") instead of `-p'.

--
* If you use `\\[bookmarkp-reverse-multi-sort-order]', then there is a difference in \
behavior between

   (a) using a plain predicate as FINAL-PRED and
   (b) using the analogous PRED-type predicate (and no FINAL-PRED).

  In the latter case, `\\[bookmarkp-reverse-multi-sort-order]' affects when the predicate \
is tried and
  its return value.  See `bookmarkp-reverse-multi-sort-order'."

Bookmark functions update the value automatically.
You probably do not want to change the value yourself.

The value is an alist with entries of the form
 (BOOKMARK-NAME . PARAM-ALIST)
or the deprecated form (BOOKMARK-NAME PARAM-ALIST).

 BOOKMARK-NAME is the name you gave to the bookmark when creating it.
 PARAM-ALIST is an alist of bookmark information.  The order of the
  entries in PARAM-ALIST is not important.  The possible entries are
  described below.  An entry with a key but null value means the entry
  is not used.

Bookmarks created using vanilla Emacs (`bookmark.el'):

 (filename . FILENAME)
 (position . POS)
 (front-context-string . STR-AFTER-POS)
 (rear-context-string  . STR-BEFORE-POS)
 (handler . HANDLER)
 (annotation . ANNOTATION)

 FILENAME names the bookmarked file.
 POS is the bookmarked buffer position (position in the file).
 STR-AFTER-POS is buffer text that immediately follows POS.
 STR-BEFORE-POS is buffer text that immediately precedes POS.
 ANNOTATION is a string that you can provide to identify the bookmark.
  See options `bookmark-use-annotations' and
  `bookmark-automatically-show-annotations'.
 HANDLER is a function that provides the bookmark-jump behavior
  for a specific kind of bookmark.  This is the case for Info
  bookmarks, for instance (starting with Emacs 23).

Bookmarks created using Bookmark+ are the same as for vanilla Emacs,
except for the following differences.

1. Visit information is recorded, using entries `visits' and `time':

 (visits . NUMBER-OF-VISITS)
 (time . TIME-LAST-VISITED)

 NUMBER-OF-VISITS is a whole-number counter.

 TIME-LAST-VISITED is an Emacs time representation, such as is
 returned by function `current-time'.

2. Bookmarks can be tagged by users.  The tag information is recorded
using entry `tags':

 (tags . TAGS-ALIST)

 TAGS-ALIST is an alist with string keys. 

3. If no file is associated with the bookmark, then FILENAME is
   `   - no file -'.

4. The following additional entries are used to record region
information.  The values are non-nil only when a region is bookmarked.
When a region is bookmarked, POS represents the region start position.

 (buffer-name . BUFFER-NAME)
 (end-position . END-POS)
 (front-context-region-string . STR-BEFORE-END-POS)
 (rear-context-region-string . STR-AFTER-END-POS))

 BUFFER-NAME is the name of a bookmarked buffer, which might not be
  associated with any file (see #1).
 END-POS is the region end position.
 STR-BEFORE-END-POS is buffer text that precedes END-POS.
 STR-AFTER-END-POS is buffer text that follows END-POS.

 NOTE: The relative locations of `front-context-region-string' and
 `rear-context-region-string' are reversed from those of
 `front-context-string' and `rear-context-string'.  For example,
 `front-context-string' is the text that *follows* `position', but
 `front-context-region-string' that *precedes* `end-position'.

5. The following additional entries are used for a Dired bookmark.

 (dired-marked . MARKED-FILES)
 (dired-switches . SWITCHES)

 MARKED-FILES is the list of files that were marked.
 SWITCHES is the string of `dired-listing-switches'.

6. The following additional entries are used for a Gnus bookmark.

 (group . GNUS-GROUP-NAME)
 (article . GNUS-ARTICLE-NUMBER)
 (message-id . GNUS-MESSAGE-ID)

 GNUS-GROUP-NAME is the name of a Gnus group.
 GNUS-ARTICLE-NUMBER is the number of a Gnus article.
 GNUS-MESSAGE-ID is the identifier of a Gnus message.

7. For a W3M bookmark, FILENAME is a W3M URL.

8. A sequence bookmark has this additional entry:

 (sequence . COMPONENT-BOOKMARKS)

 COMPONENT-BOOKMARKS is the list of component bookmark names.

9. A function bookmark has this additional entry, which records the
FUNCTION:

 (function . FUNCTION)

10. A bookmark-list bookmark has this additional entry, which records
the state of buffer `*Bookmark List*' at the time it is created:

 (bookmark-list . STATE)

 STATE records the sort order, filter function, omit list, and title.")

While entering a bookmark name at the prompt:

  "Load bookmarks from FILE (which must be in the standard format).
Without a prefix argument (argument OVERWRITE is nil), add the newly
loaded bookmarks to those already current.  They will be saved to the
current bookmark file when bookmarks are saved.  If you have never
switched bookmark files, then this is the default file,
`bookmark-default-file'.

If you do not use a prefix argument, then no existing bookmarks are
overwritten.  If you load some bookmarks that have the same names as
bookmarks already defined in your Emacs session, numeric suffixes
\"<2>\", \"<3>\",... are appended as needed to the names of those new
bookmarks to distinguish them.

With a prefix argument, switch the bookmark file currently used,
*replacing* all currently existing bookmarks with the newly loaded
bookmarks.  The value of `bookmarkp-current-bookmark-file' is changed
to FILE, so bookmarks will subsequently be saved to FILE.  The value
`bookmark-default-file' is unaffected, so your next Emacs session will
still use the same default set of bookmarks.

When called from Lisp, non-nil NO-MSG means do not display any
messages while loading.

You do not need to manually load your default bookmark file
\(`bookmark-default-file') - it is loaded automatically by Emacs the
first time you use bookmarks in a session.  Use `bookmark-load' only
to load extra bookmarks (with no prefix arg) or an alternative set of
bookmarks (with a prefix arg).

If you use `bookmark-load' to load a file that does not contain a
proper bookmark alist, then when bookmarks are saved the current
bookmark file will likely become corrupted.  You should load only
bookmark files that were created using the bookmark functions."

If a bookmark with the specified name already exists, it is
overwritten.  If a sequence bookmark with the name already exists,
then you are prompted whether to add the marked bookmarks to the
beginning of the existing sequence (or simply replace it).

Note that another existing sequence bookmark can be marked, and thus
included in the sequence bookmark created or updated.  That is, you
can include other sequences within a sequence bookmark.

  "Reverse the application of multi-sorting predicates.
These are the PRED predicates described for option
`bookmark-sort-function'.

This reverses the order in which the predicates are tried, and it
also complements the truth value returned by each predicate.

For example, if the list of multi-sorting predicates is (p1 p2 p3),
then the predicates are tried in the order: p3, p2, p1.  And if a
predicate returns true, `(t)', then the effect is as if it returned
false, `(nil)', and vice versa.

The use of multi-sorting predicates tends to group bookmarks, with the
first predicate corresponding to the first bookmark group etc.

The effect of \\<bookmark-bmenu-mode-map>`\\[bookmarkp-reverse-multi-sort-order]' is \
roughly as follows:

 - without also `\\[bookmarkp-reverse-sort-order]', it reverses the bookmark order in each \
group

 - combined with `\\[bookmarkp-reverse-sort-order]', it reverses the order of the bookmark
   groups, but not the bookmarks within a group

This is a rough description.  The actual behavior can be complex,
because of how each predicate is defined.  If this description helps
you, fine.  If not, just experiment and see what happens. \;-)

Remember that ordinary `\\[bookmarkp-reverse-sort-order]' reversal on its own is \
straightforward.
If you find `\\[bookmarkp-reverse-multi-sort-order]' confusing or not helpful, then do not \
use it."
